Web content editing tool for Midgard MVC
========================================

Important Installation Note
---------------------------

We just integrated the new [javascript framework](https://github.com/bergie/create)
to this component. This new JS framework is independent from Midgard MVC therefore
its structure is not the same as any MVC component.

You need to create a "static" directory in your local 'create' checkout and
copy or move the 'deps', 'src', and 'themes' directories there.

After this your application will not complain about missing files.
